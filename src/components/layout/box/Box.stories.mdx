# Box

`Box` component is a versatile and flexible container that allows you to easily create and organize layout elements within your application.
It's designed to simplify the process of creating and managing layout elements, by providing a variety of props and styles that you can use to customize its appearance and behavior.

Think of it like a virtual box or container that you can place other components or elements inside.
Additionally, you can customize its appearance and behavior by setting properties like padding, borders, background color, and more.

Overall, the Box component is a powerful tool that makes it easy for developers to create and manage layout elements in their application.
By using it, you can streamline your development process and create more responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Basic Usage

Box becomes padded when `padding` prop is passed to it.

```jsx
<Box padding="large">I am padded Box</Box>
```

## Responsive Padding

Padding properties can also take an object to change the padding values based on device sizes/breakpoints.

```jsx
<Box paddingX={{ mobile: 'small', tablet: 'medium', desktop: 'xlarge' }}>
	Simple Box component with padding that changes based on screen size
</Box>
```

## As Component

By default, the `Box` component renders a `div` element.
However, by setting the `as` property to a different HTML element, you can change the type of element that is rendered.
For example, you can set `as="a"` to render an anchor element instead of a `div`.

All the anchor props will be inferred and available to the component.

```jsx
<Box as="a" href="#" target="_self" padding="medium">
	This Box will act as HTML anchor
</Box>
```

## Flexbox

Pass `display="flex"` prop to enable the power of flexbox.

```jsx
<Box display="flex" justifyContent="center" alignItems="center">
	Wohoo, so flexy!
</Box>
```
